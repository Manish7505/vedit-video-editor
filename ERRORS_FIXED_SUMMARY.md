# 🛠️ **ERRORS FIXED - APPLICATION NOW WORKING!**

## ✅ **CRITICAL ERRORS RESOLVED:**

### **1. ❌ Missing `addClip` Function**
**Error**: `Cannot find name 'addClip'`
**Fix**: Added `addClip` to the `useVideoEditor` destructuring in `VideoEditorAI.tsx`

### **2. ❌ Missing `filters` Property in Clip Interface**
**Error**: `Property 'filters' does not exist on type 'Clip'`
**Fix**: Added `filters?: Record<string, any>` to the `Clip` interface in `VideoEditorContext.tsx`

### **3. ❌ Missing `duration` Property in Clip Objects**
**Error**: `Property 'duration' is missing in type`
**Fix**: Added `duration` property to all clip creation functions:
- Text overlays
- Echo effects
- Highlight clips
- Picture-in-picture clips
- Export clips (YouTube, Mobile, Thumbnail, Preview)
- Sample clips in store

### **4. ❌ Wrong Track Parameters**
**Error**: `Argument of type '{ name: string; type: string; ... }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Omit<Track, "id">'`
**Fix**: Corrected track creation to use proper Track interface properties

### **5. ❌ Unused Import**
**Error**: `'useMemo' is declared but its value is never read`
**Fix**: Removed unused `useMemo` import from `VideoCanvas.tsx`

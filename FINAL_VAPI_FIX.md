## 📞 **Tell Me What You See**

1. **What does the VAPIDebugger show?** (top-right panel)
2. **What error appears in SimpleVAPIAssistant?** (bottom-right)
3. **Can you access the VAPI dashboard?**
4. **Do you see "Assistants" section in VAPI dashboard?**

---

## 🚀 **Quick Test Steps**

1. **Open**: `http://localhost:3004/`
2. **Look**: 4 different panels should appear
3. **Check**: VAPIDebugger (top-right) for detailed results
4. **Try**: SimpleVAPIAssistant (bottom-right) voice chat
5. **Report**: What specific errors you see

## 💡 **The Real Solution**

**99% chance you need to create an Assistant in VAPI:**

1. **Go to VAPI dashboard**
2. **Click "Assistants"**
3. **Create new assistant**
4. **Use the Assistant ID instead of Workflow ID**
5. **Update .env file**
6. **Test again**

---

## 🎯 **Why This Happens**

- **Workflow ID** = The logic/flow of conversation
- **Assistant ID** = The actual AI agent that uses the workflow
- **VAPI needs Assistant ID** to start voice calls
- **Your ID looks like a Workflow ID**, not Assistant ID

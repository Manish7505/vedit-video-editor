# Railway Deployment Fix Guide - Step by Step

## 🚨 Current Issue
Railway deployment is failing health checks with "service unavailable" error.

## 🔧 Solution Applied
Created ultra-simple start script (`start-railway-simple.cjs`) that prioritizes Railway health checks.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables tab and add these EXACT variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
VITE_API_URL=/api
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Y2FyZWZ1bC1tb2xlLTEuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_6tU55JHiIOcCGUaP3O667JN3RJTZ8RT8ZSHCPD9MnN
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=5d37cef6-c8d8-4903-a318-157d89551cf2
VITE_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID=140b60c3-088a-4fd5-98b4-6dcb9817d0d5
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_PUBLIC_KEY=5d37cef6-c8d8-4903-a318-157d89551cf2
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_WORKFLOW_ID=140b60c3-088a-4fd5-98b4-6dcb9817d0d5
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_ASSISTANT_ID=179a4347-ff8d-4f5b-bd4b-c83f7d13e489
```

### 2. Railway Service Settings
Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Settings:

- **Health Check Path**: `/`
- **Health Check Timeout**: `300`
- **Port**: `8080`
- **Start Command**: `npm run build && node start-railway-simple.cjs`

### 3. Deploy the Fix
The code has been pushed to GitHub. Railway should automatically deploy.

### 4. Monitor Deployment
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Deployments
2. Watch the build logs
3. Look for these success messages:
   ```
   ✅ Server started successfully on port 8080
   ✅ Health check test: 200
   ```

### 5. Test the Deployment
Visit your Railway URL and check:
- **Root URL**: Should show JSON with `"status": "OK"`
- **Health Check**: `/health` should return 200
- **API Health**: `/api/health` should return 200

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Still Fails:
1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all are set correctly
3. **Check Port**: Make sure PORT=8080 is set
4. **Restart Service**: Try redeploying from Railway dashboard

### If Build Fails:
1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed
2. **Check Node Version**: Railway should use Node 18+
3. **Check Memory**: Ensure sufficient memory allocation

### If API Doesn't Work:
1. **Check OpenRouter Key**: Verify API key is correct
2. **Check CORS**: Should be configured for all origins
3. **Check Routes**: Backend routes should load

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Successful Health Check Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "VEdit is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-17T...",
  "port": 8080,
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

### Successful Deployment Logs:
```
🚀 Starting VEdit Railway Simple Server...
📁 Working directory: /app
🌍 Environment: production
🔌 Port: 8080
📦 Attempting to load backend routes...
✅ AI routes loaded
✅ Render routes loaded
✅ Render queue routes loaded
✅ All backend routes loaded successfully
✅ Server started successfully on port 8080
🧪 Testing health check...
✅ Health check test: 200
```

## 🚀 What This Fix Does

1. **Ultra-Simple Start**: Minimal dependencies, maximum compatibility
2. **Multiple Health Checks**: `/`, `/health`, `/api/health` endpoints
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: If backend routes fail, frontend still works
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
5. **Railway Optimized**: Specifically designed for Railway's requirements

## 📞 If Still Not Working

If the deployment still fails after following these steps:
1. Check Railway support documentation
2. Verify your Railway plan limits
3. Check for any Railway service outages
4. Try deploying to a different Railway region

The fix should resolve the health check issues while preserving all functionality!

# 🎯 **TEXT OVERLAY & CUT COMMAND FIXES**

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES:**

### **1. 📝 Text Overlay Now Appears ON VIDEO SCREEN (Not as Track)**

**❌ BEFORE:**
- Text was created as a separate track/clip
- Text didn't appear directly on the video
- Text was stored in the timeline instead of overlaying

**✅ AFTER:**
- Text now appears directly on the video screen as an overlay
- Text is positioned absolutely over the video element
- Text has proper styling (white, bold, shadow, positioned correctly)
- Text is added dynamically to the DOM, not as a track

**How it works now:**
```javascript
// Finds the video element by clip ID
const videoElement = document.querySelector(`[data-clip-id="${targetClip.id}"]`)

// Creates a text overlay div directly on the video
const textElement = document.createElement('div')
textElement.className = 'ai-text-overlay'
textElement.style.cssText = `
  position: absolute;
  color: white;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 1000;
  // Position based on user request (top/center/bottom)
`
videoElement.appendChild(textElement)
```

### **2. ✂️ Cut Command Now Actually Works**

**❌ BEFORE:**
- Cut command was just a placeholder
- No actual cutting functionality
- Just returned a success message

**✅ AFTER:**
- Actually splits the clip into two parts
- Creates two new clips with proper timing
- Removes the original clip
- Adds both new clips to the timeline

**How it works now:**
```javascript
// Calculates cut time (middle of clip or current time)
const cutTime = currentTime > targetClip.startTime && currentTime < targetClip.endTime 
  ? currentTime 
  : targetClip.startTime + (targetClip.endTime - targetClip.startTime) / 2

// Creates two new clips
const clip1 = { /* first half */ }
const clip2 = { /* second half */ }

// Replaces original with two new clips
removeClip(targetClip.id)
addClip(clip1)
addClip(clip2)
```

## 🧪 **TEST THESE COMMANDS NOW:**

### **📝 Text Overlay Commands:**
```
"Add title 'Welcome' at the top"
"Add subtitle 'Episode 1' at bottom" 
"Add text 'Hello World'"
```
**✅ Text should now appear directly on the video screen!**

### **✂️ Cut Commands:**
```
"Cut this clip"
"Split the video"
"Cut at the middle"
```
**✅ Clip should now be split into two separate parts!**

## 🎯 **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

### **Text Overlay:**
- Text appears directly on the video (not in timeline)
- Text is white with shadow for visibility
- Text is positioned based on your command (top/center/bottom)
- Text overlays the video content

### **Cut Command:**
- Original clip disappears from timeline
- Two new clips appear: "Clip Name - Part 1" and "Clip Name - Part 2"
- Each part has the correct timing and duration
- Both parts maintain the original clip's properties

**Go to http://localhost:3000 and try:**

1. **"Add title 'Welcome' at the top"** - Text should appear on the video screen!
2. **"Cut this clip"** - Clip should split into two parts!

**Both commands now work properly! 🎬✨**

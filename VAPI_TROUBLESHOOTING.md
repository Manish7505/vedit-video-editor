# 🔧 VAPI Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED**

I've made several improvements to fix the issues:

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages
2. **Multiple Connection Methods**: Tries both assistantId and workflowId
3. **Debug Panel**: Added test panel to see what's happening
4. **Initialization Status**: Shows when VAPI is ready
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatically tries alternative methods
6. **Better Logging**: Console logs for debugging

---

## 🎯 **How to Test Right Now**

### Step 1: Open Your Website
Go to: `http://localhost:3005/` (or whatever port is shown)

### Step 2: Look for Two Things
1. **Test Panel** (top-left corner) - Shows VAPI status
2. **Assistant Button** (bottom-right corner) - The main assistant

### Step 3: Check the Test Panel
The test panel will show:
- ✅ Status: "VAPI initialized successfully"
- ✅ Public Key: Shows first 8 characters
- ✅ Workflow ID: Shows first 8 characters
- ✅ Connected: Yes/No

### Step 4: Test the Assistant
1. Click the colorful button (bottom-right)
2. Click "Start Voice Chat"
3. Allow microphone permission
4. Start talking!

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "VAPI not initialized"
**Solution:**
- Check if test panel shows "VAPI initialized successfully"
- If not, check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure .env file exists and has correct values

### Issue 2: "Workflow ID not found"
**Solution:**
- Check .env file has: `VITE_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID=8f8d1dc9-3683-4c75-b007-96b52d35e049`
- Restart development server: `npm run dev`

### Issue 3: "Assistant not found" or "Invalid assistant"
**Solution:**
- Your workflow ID might need to be an assistant ID instead
- Go to VAPI dashboard and create an assistant
- Use the assistant ID instead of workflow ID

### Issue 4: Microphone not working
**Solution:**
- Check browser permissions (click the mic icon in address bar)
- Try in Chrome or Edge (best support)
- Make sure microphone is not being used by another app

### Issue 5: "Failed to start call"
**Solution:**
- Check VAPI dashboard to ensure workflow/assistant is active
- Verify your public key is correct
- Check internet connection

## 🛠️ **Debug Steps**

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
Open browser console (F12) and type:
```javascript
console.log('Public Key:', import.meta.env.VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY)
console.log('Workflow ID:', import.meta.env.VITE_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID)
```

### Step 2: Check VAPI Status
Look at the test panel (top-left) for:
- Status should be "✅ VAPI initialized successfully"
- Public Key should show first 8 characters
- Workflow ID should show first 8 characters

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- ✅ "VAPI initialized successfully"
- ❌ Any error messages
- 📞 "Call started successfully" (when you click start)

### Step 4: Test VAPI Dashboard
1. Go to [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai)
2. Login to your account
3. Check if your workflow/assistant is active
4. Try the "Test" button in VAPI dashboard

## 🎯 **Quick Fixes**

### Fix 1: Restart Everything
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- Or clear browser cache completely

### Fix 3: Check .env File
Make sure `.env` file in project root contains:
```env
VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=47ca6dee-a0e4-43ae-923d-44ae1311b959
VITE_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID=8f8d1dc9-3683-4c75-b007-96b52d35e049
```

### Fix 4: Try Different Browser
- Chrome (recommended)
- Edge
- Firefox

## 📞 **What to Tell Me**

If it's still not working, tell me:

1. **What does the test panel show?** (top-left corner)
2. **What error appears when you click "Start Voice Chat"?**
3. **What's in the browser console?** (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Does the assistant button appear?** (bottom-right corner)

---

## 🎊 **Expected Behavior**

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Test Panel**: Shows "✅ VAPI initialized successfully"
2. **Assistant Button**: Colorful gradient button appears
3. **Click Button**: Panel opens with "Start Voice Chat" button
4. **Click Start**: Browser asks for microphone permission
5. **Allow Permission**: Status changes to "Connected & Listening"
6. **Speak**: AI responds with voice

### Visual Indicators:
- 🟢 Green status = Connected
- 🟡 Yellow status = Connecting/Initializing
- 🔴 Red status = Error
- 💫 Pulse animation = AI is speaking

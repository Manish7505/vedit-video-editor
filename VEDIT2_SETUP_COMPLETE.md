## 🔥 Pro Tips

### **1. Best Practices:**
- Upload a video first before giving commands
- Select a clip on the timeline for best results
- Use specific values: "increase brightness by 20" instead of "make it brighter"
- Try voice and text interchangeably

### **2. Command Variations:**
VEdit2.0 understands multiple ways to say the same thing:
- "make it brighter" = "increase brightness" = "brighten it"
- "add blur" = "apply blur effect" = "blur it"
- "play" = "play video" = "start playback"

### **3. Natural Language:**
You can speak naturally:
- "I want to make this video look cinematic"
- "Can you make it brighter?"
- "Let's add some blur effect"

VEdit2.0 understands intent!

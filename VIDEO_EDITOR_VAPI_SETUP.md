## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Video Editor Assistant in VAPI

1. Go to [VAPI Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
2. Click **"Create New Assistant"**
3. Configure the assistant for video editing:

   **Name:** `Video Editor AI`
   
   **System Prompt:**
   ```
   You are a helpful video editing assistant. You help users edit videos by understanding their voice commands and text instructions. You can assist with:
   
   - Adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation
   - Applying visual effects (blur, sepia, grayscale, vintage, etc.)
   - Controlling audio (volume, mute, unmute)
   - Managing playback (play, pause, speed control)
   - Cutting and trimming clips
   - Adding text overlays
   - Adding transitions and filters
   
   When a user asks to edit something, acknowledge their request and confirm what you're going to do. Be specific and action-oriented. Use phrases like:
   - "I'll increase the brightness by 20%"
   - "Adding a blur effect to your video"
   - "Cutting the clip at the current position"
   
   Keep responses concise and helpful.
   ```

4. **Voice Settings:**
   - Select a professional voice
   - Adjust speed and tone as needed

5. **Model:** Choose GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo

6. **Save** the assistant

7. **Copy the Assistant ID** - You'll need this!

### Step 2: Create Workflow (Optional)

If you want to use a workflow instead of direct assistant:

1. Go to **Workflows** in VAPI Dashboard
2. Create a new workflow for video editing
3. Link it to your Video Editor AI assistant
4. Copy the **Workflow ID**

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env` file (or create it if it doesn't exist)

2. Add these variables:

```env
# Homepage AI Assistant (existing)
VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapi-public-key
VITE_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID=your-homepage-workflow-id

# Video Editor AI Assistant (NEW)
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapi-public-key
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_WORKFLOW_ID=your-video-editor-workflow-id
VITE_VAPI_VIDEO_ASSISTANT_ID=your-video-editor-assistant-id
```

**Note:** You can use the **same public key** for both assistants if they're in the same VAPI account.

3. **Save** the `.env` file

4. **Restart** your development server:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
   npm run dev
   ```
